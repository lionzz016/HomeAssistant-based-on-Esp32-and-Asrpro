使用须知：
1.'/ASRPRO_Module'下的两个文件:'_code'后缀代表其为纯代码编写版本，'_edit'后缀代表其为图形化配置版本。
2.需要注意的是，前者为后者通过配置生成的代码，后者需要在能编译该文件的软件(如天问51)上才能识别。
3.由于后者在图形化配置下的劣势，其依旧存在一些函数的不正确使用。
4.前者非完全直接由后者配置生成，存在代码二次修改，为此推荐使用前者来编译，后者仅供学习参考。

Precautions:
1. Two files under '/ASRPRO_Module': the '_code' suffix means it's a code-only version, and the '_edit' suffix means it's a graphical configuration version.
2. It should be noted that the former is the code generated by the latter through configuration, and the latter needs to be recognized on the software that can compile the file (such as Tianwen 51).
3. Due to the disadvantages of the latter in graphical configuration, there are still some incorrect use of functions.
4. The former is not completely directly generated by the latter configuration, and there are secondary modifications to the code, so it is recommended to use the former to compile, and the latter is only for learning reference.
